# About The Code 
The program fetches data from a popular CSV file that contains data and information about all the passengers who were on the Titanic ship right on the day of the catastrophic event. The motive of this program is to plot a bar graph and a piechart in a single figure using matplotlib in order to show all the survivors among the deaths and also to compare the surviving likelihood of a survivor based on his/her sex, age (below or under 18) and passenger class. The program aims to gather insights from the day of the event.

Note: The probability is out of the total survivors and not the total strength of the ship. As the death toll is very high.
