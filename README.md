# About The Code 
The program fetches data from a popular CSV file that contains data about all the passengers who were on the Titanic ship till the day of the catastrophic event. The motive is to plot a bar graph and a pie chart in a single figure using Matplotlib Subplots to show all the survivors, and also to compare the survival probability of a passenger based on his/her sex, age (below or under 18), and passenger class (1st, 2nd & 3rd class). The project aims to gather insights from the day of the event.
